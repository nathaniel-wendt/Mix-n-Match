# Mix-n-Match Memory Game

## Description

Memory Game from Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. I was given basic HTML/CSS starter code along with a JavaScript shuffle function. From there I had to research and build a complete game using vanilla JS.

## Installation

Download or clone the project from this repository- then open the `index.html` in your browser of choice and start playing!

## How to Play

Begin by clicking to turn over any two cards. If the cards match, they will turn green and stay face up.  If they don't match they will automatically flip back over. Remember what was on each card and where the cards were. A timer begins as soon as the first card is flipped and you are scored based on the number of moves (flipping two cards counts as one move). The game is finished when all cards have been matched. Can you beat the game with all 5 stars?

## Project Features

• The game randomly shuffles the cards. It does so on first load, on 'reset', and from a 'play again' button.
• Game tracks the number of moves the player has made (flipping two cards counts as one move).
• Game displays a star rating (from 1 to 5) that reflects the player's performance. Winning with fewer moves results in a higher score.
• Game tracks time, starting on first card flip and stops when all cards are matched.
• When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congradulate them. It tells the user how much time it took to win the game, and what their star rating was.
• A reset button that allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
